    "Methodology\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "    Build a mid-cap-oriented test universe for transcript-based signal backtesting,\n",
    "    restricted to the top 2 performing sectors (identified from prior Sharpe analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Data Source:\n",
    "    - Start with S&P 500 constituents (Wikipedia table).\n",
    "    - Keep only tickers added on/before 2015-12-31 (ensures membership in 2015).\n",
    "    - NOTE: Wikipedia doesn’t list removal dates; all tickers are marked “Present”\n",
    "      unless using CRSP/Compustat for point-in-time accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Market Cap Screen:\n",
    "    - Fetch current float-adjusted market capitalization from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "    - Exclude any ticker with current cap > $50B.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sector Tagging:\n",
    "    - Use Yahoo Finance “sector” field to assign sectors.\n",
    "    - Restrict universe to the top 2 chosen sectors only\n",
    "      (e.g., Financials + Utilities/Insurance, and Information Technology/Industrials).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sector Balance:\n",
    "    - Cap each of the 2 chosen sectors at ≤25 names (configurable).\n",
    "    - Ensures roughly even representation, but total = 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Sampling:\n",
    "    - Randomly sample exactly 50 tickers from this restricted pool.\n",
    "    - Random seed fixed for reproducibility.\n",
    "    - Output includes Ticker, Company, Sector, S&P_Start, S&P_End, CurMktCap.\n",

    "# Methodology\n",
    "# -----------\n",
    "# Goal:\n",
    "#     Build a representative, mid-cap-oriented test universe for backtesting\n",
    "#     transcript-based signals, without distortion from mega-caps like AAPL/MSFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps:\n",
    "# 1. Data Source:\n",
    "#     - Start with the S&P 500 constituents table from Wikipedia.\n",
    "#     - Keep only tickers with \"Date Added\" <= 2015-12-31, which ensures the\n",
    "#       company was a member of the index at some point during 2015.\n",
    "#     - NOTE: Wikipedia only lists the date a company joined the index; it does\n",
    "#       not provide removal dates. For simplicity, all tickers are treated as\n",
    "#       “Present” members unless removed manually. For point-in-time accuracy,\n",
    "#       replace with CRSP/Compustat (WRDS) data if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Market Cap Screen:\n",
    "#     - Fetch current float-adjusted market capitalization from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "#     - Exclude any ticker with current cap > $50B (configurable).\n",
    "#     - Rationale: although all S&P 500 members are technically “large-cap,”\n",
    "#       this filter strips out long-standing mega-caps and approximates a\n",
    "#       mid-cap cohort more sensitive to sentiment shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Sector Tagging:\n",
    "#     - Retrieve each company’s GICS sector from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "#     - Attach sector labels to allow balancing across industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Sector Balance:\n",
    "#     - Cap each sector at a maximum of 10 names (configurable).\n",
    "#     - This prevents over-representation from high-density categories such as\n",
    "#       Utilities or REITs.\n",
    "#     - Optionally, one could enforce a minimum per sector, but in this version\n",
    "#       some sectors may be absent if they had <1 eligible ticker under $50B.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Final Sampling:\n",
    "#     - Randomly sample exactly 50 tickers from the capped pool.\n",
    "#     - Random seed is fixed (42) to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "#     - Output includes: Ticker, Company, Sector, S&P_Start (date added),\n",
    "#       S&P_End (“Present”), and current market cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Caveats:\n",
    "#     - Membership dates are approximate (based only on “Date Added”).\n",
    "#     - End dates are not captured unless using WRDS/CRSP.\n",
    "#     - Market cap screen uses *current* capitalization as a proxy; companies\n",
    "#       that briefly crossed $50B in the past but are below today remain in.\n",
    "#     - If fewer than 50 names survive filtering, the script raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Cases:\n",
